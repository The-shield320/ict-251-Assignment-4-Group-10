INSTRUCTIONS ON RUNNING ALL THE CODES:
1. First run the html file(ngo.html). This contains the actual code together with the javascript file(app.js), an external stylesheet(style.css), and a single page for User Interface(UI), records.html.
2. The videos on the webpage are not playing because they were not being uploaded on Github because they contained large sizes.
3. The backend is also uploaded GitHub, and we presented it during presentations and our work was excellent!
